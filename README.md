# Silhouette #

Silhouette was created to help the University of Waterloo's Campus Response Team to manage applicants by

- Easily storing and displaying applicants scores at various stations
- Allows for easy sorting into buckets (e.g. "Yes", "No", "Maybe") when making acceptance decisions
- Very easy navigation

## Libraries ##

Silhouette uses the amazing Rails Admin gem (sferik/rails_admin) for initital CRUD operations.
The viewing interface uses Reveal.js (hakimel/reveal.js), for easy and beautiful slideshows.
