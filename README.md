# Silhouette #

Silhouette was created to help the University of Waterloo's Campus Response Team to manage applicants by

- Easily storing and displaying applicants scores at various stations
- Allows for easy sorting into buckets (e.g. "Yes", "No", "Maybe") when making acceptance decisions
- Very easy navigation

## Libraries ##

Silhouette uses the amazing [Rails Admin](http://github.com/sferif/rails_admin) Admin gem  for initital CRUD operations.
The viewing interface uses [Reveal.js](http://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), for easy and beautiful slideshows.
